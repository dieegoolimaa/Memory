**Memory Game**

This is a memory game web application where players try to match all the social media platform icon cards. The game includes features like:

**Matching Gameplay:** Click on any two cards to reveal their pictures. If the pictures match, the cards stay flipped. Otherwise, they flip back over.
**Restart Functionality:** Players can easily restart the game with a single click after completing it.
**Time-Based Challenge:** A timer counts down during gameplay, adding a layer of challenge.
**Motivational Messages:** The game displays congratulatory messages upon winning and encouraging messages when time runs out.

**How to Play**
Open the game in a web browser.
Click the "Let's start!" button on the welcome screen.
The game board will appear with face-down cards.
Click on any two cards to reveal their icons.
Try to memorize the locations of matching icons.
If the cards you clicked match, they will stay flipped, and you earn points.
If the cards don't match, they will flip back over.
Keep clicking on cards to try and match all of them.
The game ends when you match all the cards or when the timer runs out.

**Scoring**
Players earn points for each successful match.
A time bonus is awarded for completing the game faster.

**Restarting the Game**
Once the game ends, a "Restart Game" button will appear.
Click this button to start a new game.

**Going Back to Home Page**
A "Go Back" button is provided to return to the welcome screen from the end-game screen.
